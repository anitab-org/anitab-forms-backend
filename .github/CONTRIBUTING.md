# General Guidelines

- If you’re just getting started to work on an issue labeled “First Timers Only” in any project, You can refer to additional resources available on our [website](http://systers.io/).
- In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments section or discuss it in their respective #questions stream on zulip and the maintainer will assign the issue to you.
- After approval, you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working. Remember to update your progress through comments after every 3 days, otherwise, the maintainer can reassign the issue.
- You can't submit a PR from the base branch on your fork. Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on and send a PR from that branch.
- Remember to follow the PR template while sending PR.
- If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues.
- Follow the issue template while reporting new issues. Have a short description of what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
- If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
