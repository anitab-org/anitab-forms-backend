Python is the major language in the backend. So, the following are the coding practices and standards which are being used in the project.

## Style Guide for Python
### The PEP8 style guidelines
- The documentation gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.
- This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

Checkout the official documentation [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Testing
### Postman & Newman
- [Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) is a powerful command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections the same way they are executed inside the collection runner in Postman.
- You can write easy tests for requests, or the complete collection.
