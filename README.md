Open Source Programs (OSP) is an application that simplifies the processing and selection procedure of Open Source Programs of AnitaB.org Open Source or other third-party programs. This is the Backend repo for OSP.

## Tech Stack
- Django 3.0.7
- Django REST Framework 3.11.0
- Python 3.7+

## API Documentation
- [Postman Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11324046/Szzoaw1q?version=latest)

## Setup 
To setup the project locally go through [this wiki page](https://github.com/anitab-org/open-source-programs-web/wiki/Fork,-Clone,-Remote-and-Pull-Request).
Make sure you have installed the following:
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/install-procedure.html)

Next follow these instructions.

1. **Database Setup:** Before starting with the project create a db in you local using PostgreSQL with the following details. Refer to `main/settings.py` if you have any confusion.

    ```
    NAME: osp
    USER: osp
    PASSWORD: osp
    HOST: localhost
    ``` 
    You may run the following commands for local setup of DB in Linux:

    ```
    cd open-source-programs-backend
    sudo -i -u postgres
    createuser osp --pwprompt
    psql
    CREATE DATABASE osp;
    \c osp;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE osp to osp;
    ```
2. You need to download API key file from your user-settings on Zulip. The file you download is named as 'download' or rename that to 'download'.
3. Place that download file in the project's directory.

4. Move into the project's directory.

    ```
    cd open-source-programs-backend
    ```
5. Create virtual environment (this is not a hard requirement, but its advisable)
    ```
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. To run the migrations run: 
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. To run the server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
8. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
9. To change the port you may run `python manage.py runserver <port_number>`
10. To run the migrations run: `python manage.py migrate`
11. You can terminate the process by `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

Follow the given instructions for Login into the app.

1. You can register a new user by setting up SendGrid details in the `settings.py`, you can take a reference from [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api/)

2. To create the superuser run:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ````
   Fill up the things it asked to and then Login into the app.

## Testing

To run the tests run: `python manage.py test`.

## QA Checks

Before creating a pull-request, always run QA checks to make your code more readable and error-free. Steps to run QA checks are:
1. Install QA checks dependencies:
    ```
    pip install black==20.8b1
    pip install isort==5.7.0
    pip install flake8==3.8.4
    ```
2. Run QA checks: `./osp-qa-checks`.

### Run with Docker

1. Make sure the latest version of docker and docker-compose are installed.

- For **docker** run ``docker -v`` from your terminal. If docker is not installed, install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- For **docker-compose** run ``docker-compose -v`` from terminal. If it is not installed then install it by running ``pip install docker-compose`` or from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Change Database HOST in ``settings.py``

- Go to ``main/settings.py``
- Under databases change host to db.

3. **Build docker image**

Execute ``sudo docker-compose run web`` to build the image.

4. **Run docker image**

Run ``sudo docker-compose up`` from the root directory of project. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

**Note** 
- Run `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the image.
- To **interact** with docker containers use ``docker exec -it {container id} bash`` from your terminal. Container id can be found using ``docker ps``.
